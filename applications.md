 1. Reproducible Research - Scientists share exact OS environment via IPFS CID, others reproduce experiments     
  with identical Linux state = solves "works on my machine" for science
  2. Collaborative Dev Environments - Team works on same Linux instance, blockchain syncs state real-time,        
  everyone sees identical environment = pair programming on steroids
  3. Immortal Game Servers - Minecraft/game state stored on blockchain, no single host needed, community-run,     
  survives forever on IPFS = truly decentralized multiplayer

  Focus: State persistence + collaboration + decentralization

> still give top 3 of economic value think harder 

‚óè Top 3 Economic Value Applications:

  1. Pay-per-use Serverless Linux ($$$) - No always-on server costs, resume from blockchain only when needed.     
  AWS Lambda but for full OS = save 90% on idle server costs for millions of businesses
  2. Decentralized Compute Marketplace ($$) - People rent browser CPU time, blockchain verifies work done.        
  Buyers pay 50% less than AWS, sellers earn passive income = two-sided marketplace like Airbnb for computing     
  3. Zero-hosting SaaS ($) - Deploy web app once to IPFS, runs in users' browsers, state on blockchain, zero      
  server bills forever = eliminates biggest SaaS cost (infrastructure), pure profit on subscriptions

  Economic impact: Eliminate hosting costs (biggest SaaS expense)


 we have implemented 1 and 3 out the following 
  1. Pay-per-use Serverless Linux ($$$) - No always-on server costs, resume from blockchain only when needed.

now we need to increase cpu capacity how will we do it give logic , flow of logic and flow of execution , be      
concise \
