Phase 3: Multi-Party Computation - Defeating Hardware Backdoors
======================================================================

=== Starting MPC Network ===
Multiple architectures for Byzantine fault tolerance:

[MPC-laptop] Running on x86_64 arch, port 9001
[MPC-phone] Running on ARM64 arch, port 9002
[MPC-pi] Running on ARMv7 arch, port 9003

MPC network ready for secure computation

[MPC-riscv] Running on RISC-V arch, port 9004
[MPC-cloud] Running on x86_64 arch, port 9005

--- Test 1: File Access Request ---

[MPC] Executing file_read across 5 nodes
  [laptop] x86_64     → Response received
  [phone] ARM64      → Response received
  [pi] ARMv7      → Response received
  [riscv] RISC-V     → Response received
  [cloud] x86_64     → Response received

[✓] Consensus achieved: 5/5 nodes agree
Decision: allowed:True

--- Test 2: Suspicious File Access ---

[MPC] Executing file_read across 5 nodes
  [laptop] x86_64     → Response received
  [phone] ARM64      → Response received
  [pi] ARMv7      → Response received
  [riscv] RISC-V     → Response received
  [cloud] x86_64     → Response received

[✓] Consensus achieved: 5/5 nodes agree
[✓] Suspicious access blocked by consensus!

--- Test 3: Camera Access Request ---

[MPC] Executing camera_access across 5 nodes
  [laptop] x86_64     → Response received
  [phone] ARM64      → Response received
  [pi] ARMv7      → Response received
  [riscv] RISC-V     → Response received
  [cloud] x86_64     → Response received

[✓] Consensus achieved: 5/5 nodes agree
Camera access: vote:approve
[!] LED will be forced ON by hardware consensus

--- Test 4: Network Connection Request ---

[MPC] Executing network_access across 5 nodes
  [laptop] x86_64     → Response received
  [phone] ARM64      → Response received
  [pi] ARMv7      → Response received
  [riscv] RISC-V     → Response received
  [cloud] x86_64     → Response received

[✓] Consensus achieved: 5/5 nodes agree
Network access: allowed:True

======================================================================
MPC Demonstration Complete
Key insight: Even if your laptop is compromised by Intel ME,
it cannot override the consensus of ARM and RISC-V nodes!
