 ☐ Add homomorphic boot verification
     ☐ Create network isolation layer

     We don't run Ubuntu ON blockchain, we make Ubuntu BECOME the blockchain where every participating device is
   a node.

   Now we need to show how these components enable Ubuntu to run on blockchain where:
  - The OS state is on blockchain
  - Every system call is a transaction
  - Consensus validates every operation
  - The laptop is just a viewport into the distributed OS

 ☒ Implement ZK proof for hardware integrity
     ☒ Create complete system integration test
     ☒ Create network isolation layer
     ☒ Implement homomorphic boot verification
     ☐ Create production deployment checklist
     ☐ Setup blockchain infrastructure
     ☐ Create Docker containers for nodes
     ☐ Deploy consensus network
     ☐ Create user onboarding system
     ☐ Setup monitoring and analytics

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants to deploy the Ubuntu blockchain OS system to production so anyone on the internet can use it. This is a 
  significant undertaking that requires careful planning. I need to create a comprehensive production deployment checklist and 
  supporting infrastructure. 

  Let me think about what's needed:

  1. Infrastructure deployment (servers, blockchain nodes)
  2. Docker containers for easy deployment
  3. Kubernetes orchestration for scale
  4. User onboarding and key management
  5. Web interface for easy access
  6. API endpoints
  7. Security hardening for production
  8. Monitoring and alerting
  9. Documentation for users
  10. Legal/compliance considerations
  11. Cost optimization
  12. Disaster recovery
  13. Update mechanisms

  I'll create a comprehensive production deployment checklist and supporting files.
